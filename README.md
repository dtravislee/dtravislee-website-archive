# D. Travis Lee: Archive

This is an archive for posts no longer fitting on the main website, http://dtravislee.netlify.com

These posts are formatted for reading on github.com, though (I imagine) all Markdown readers should be able to parse through this content and provide a decent end result.

Posts are most likely to end up here due to hosting space limitations, but can be posted here for any number of reasons, usually listed in the initial commits of files.

Posts are edited to remove non-Markdown formatting, such as HTML and Hugo shortcodes, that would ruin reading on github.com. Tables of contents are generated using [DocToc on HerokuApp](http://doctoc.herokuapp.com/). Otherwise, initial commits are unedited from their originals.

Happy reading.
